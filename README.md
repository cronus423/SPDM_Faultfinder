 This code is based on [Fault-Finder](https://github.com/fault-finder/fault-finder), with several modifications to enable its use for analysing SPDM-EMU. The changes include the addition of a new type of bit-flip attack — memory-targeted bit flips — as well as the implementation of several hooks to support functionalities such as malloc(), free(), and random number generation.
